# Changelog

## [1.5.5] - 2025-06-01
### Added
- Added exception handling in `CsvReader::read()` to capture and return error messages for debugging purposes. This enhancement is documented in the [README](README.md) file, where users can find detailed error messages when exceptions occur during CSV processing, improving the ability to diagnose issues.
- Introduced default values for the `callBackResult` in callback processing to ensure consistent behavior when no keys are returned. The default structure is as follows:
```php
  $callBackResult = [
    'status' = true,
    'column_errors' = [],
    'exception = '' // New key
  ];
```
- Added tests to verify the correct handling of the new `exception` key in the `callBackResult` structure, ensuring that error messages are captured and returned as expected during CSV processing. These tests validate that the system behaves correctly when exceptions occur, improving overall reliability and debuggability.


### Fixed
- Resolved an issue where an exception was thrown if the custom validation callback did not return a `status` key, ensuring smoother error handling during CSV processing.

## [1.5.4] - 2025-05-28
### Added
- Added a check for the CSV reader to ignore empty rows during processing. If an empty row is encountered, it will be skipped without halting the processing of subsequent data. For example, if the CSV contains the following rows: 
  ```
  name,email
  John Doe,john@example.com
  
  Jane Smith,jane@example.com
  ```
  The processing will continue and include both "John Doe" and "Jane Smith" despite the empty row in between.
- New test case to verify that processing continues when an empty row is encountered, allowing subsequent data to be processed.

## [1.5.3] - 2025-05-21
### Changed
- Enhanced header processing in `CsvReader::read()` to automatically remove extra spaces between words in headers. This ensures that headers are normalized, improving data consistency and reducing potential errors during processing.

## [1.5.2] - 2025-05-19
### Added
- Added support for CSV files without headers in `CsvReader::read()`. The method can now process files that do not contain a header row, allowing for more flexible input formats. When no headers are present, the columns will be indexed numerically (0, 1, 2, ...).
- Empty rows are now automatically skipped during processing, but their occurrence is recorded for reference.
- Added the `toJSON()` method to output results in JSON format, providing a structured representation of the processed data.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where processing CSV files without headers would lead to incorrect column mapping and validation errors.

## [1.5.1] - 2025-05-18
### Added
- Added `csv_file_input_type` property to the results array to indicate the type of input file being processed. This property can have one of the following values:
  - `stream`: When the input is a PHP stream resource
  - `uploaded`: When the input is an uploaded file from $_FILES
  - `file_path`: When the input is a regular file path (e.g., `/path/to/data.csv`)
  - `Unknown`: When the input type cannot be determined

### Fixed
- Fixed an error caused by a redundant check in isFileUploaded method.
- Fixed a bug where reading regular csv file causes a PHP error.

## [1.5.0] - 2025-05-17
### Added
- Added support for file streams and uploaded files in `CsvReader::read()`. The method now accepts both file paths and file streams as input.
- Added validation for stream resource types and proper stream handling.

### Fixed
- Various issues when uploading file streams.
- Minor bugs

### Changed
- Updated readme

## [1.4.0] - 2025-05-16
### Added
- Validation in `CsvReader::read()` to detect and flag rows with an incorrect number of columns (extra or missing columns compared to the header). Such rows are now reported as errors and skipped from further processing. 

### Fixed
- Added validation to ensure all columns defined in the configuration are present in the CSV header. If any required columns are missing, an error is now reported and processing is halted.

### Changed
- Made the following class properties static to ensure consistent configuration across all instances:
  - `$error_threshold`
  - `$is_downloadable`
  - `$directory_path`
  - `$file_name`
- Renamed the `set_callback` method to `setCallback` to adhere to the project's camelCase naming convention for functions. (A breaking change)
- Refactored `CsvReader::read()` by removing the redundant second parameter `$callback`. Callback functionality should now be set exclusively via the `setCallback()` method prior to reading.

## [1.3.2] - 2025-05-15
### Fixed
- Improved date validation: columns with `type: date` now only accept the following formats: `m/d/Y`, `m-d-Y`, `Y-m-d`, and `Y/m/d`. Invalid date formats are now correctly detected and reported.  
  _(See: `CsvReader.php`, `ValidationTest.php`)_

### Added
- Added support for headers containing parenthesis, such as labels or format hints (e.g., `birthday(M/D/Y)`). Headers with parenthesis are now correctly recognized and mapped to their respective columns.
  _(See: `CsvReader.php`, `ValidationTest.php`)_
- Added strict date validation helper function which uses regex.



## [1.3.1] - 2025-05-14
### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where columns with type `date` would always return `false` during validation.
- Fixed a bug where `rows_processed` was not set when `is_downloadable` was `true`, which caused certain tests to fail.

## [1.3.0] - 2025-05-13
### Added
- Added a new feature: users can now modify rows using the callback by returning an array with `'status' => true` and `'row' => $modifiedRow`.
- Added the ability to skip processing of a row from within the callback by returning an array with `'status' => false` and `'skip' => true`.

### Changed
- Removed the `required` and `unique` column definitions from the column configuration.
- The `required` and `unique` validations are now specified inside the `validate` key for each column, e.g. `validate => 'required|unique|max_length[10]'`.
- All column validations are now specified in the `validate` string, including `required`, `unique`, `min_length`, `max_length`, `lowercase`, `uppercase`, `strip_tags`, `htmlentities`, `strip_quotes`, and `urlencode`. For example: `validate => 'required|unique|min_length[3]|max_length[10]|lowercase'`.
- If the `type` is not set for a column, it now defaults to `string`.
- Added more internal validations for better data integrity and error reporting.
- Various minor bug fixes and improvements to error handling and validation logic.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-05-12
### Added
- Added progress callback feature: You can now set a progress callback to receive updates on CSV processing progress, including support for custom callback intervals.
- Updated README to document the progress callback usage and configuration.

## [1.1.1] - 2025-05-11
### Fixed
- Fixed errors path in CSV error file handling.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-05-10
### Added
- Added new column definition option: `allowed_values`.

## [1.0.1] - 2025-05-09
### Fixed
- Fixed incorrect package name in README.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-05-08
### Added
- Initial release.
- Required PHP 8.2.
- Added date validations and documentation.
- Added tests.
- Updated README.
